Hello, Eddy!
Your garden is overgrown and your cucumbers are soft!
Do not burn the candle at both ends, as it leads to the life of a hairdresser.
May the fleas from your cow inflame your rhubarb!
Ed Boy…
May your nose fester with the rage of olives!
MY PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN LIKE MY MAMA'S HEAD OF HAIR!
THE BURDEN OF HOSPITALITY IS TOO GREAT FOR ROLF!
You have broken a celery stalk on the back of a sea urchin!
Hello, Ed Boys. Why must you spoil Wilfred with this lavish monkey suit? This will only lead him to search for a life as an airline steward.
Rolf respects your vow to uphold the sticky notes of elders, yet *puts on the Hat of Discipline* you must be punished.
Very impressive, Ed Boy. It is a shame you fail with such disgrace at your pitiful attempt to prove your sorry and feeble effort at becoming an Urban Ranger.
Ed Boys! Your mattress has ruptured Rolf's tail bone! Who is in charge of this double-crossing slumber flim-flammery?!
The stench of immortal doom still thickens the air, yes? Or, perhaps it is Wilfred's cabbage evacuations? Hard to tell.
The days of reckoning are upon us, half naked Ed boys, for it is here that we will be mercilessly judged
This alphabet F confounds Rolf to no end! Phooey! Rolf would not line Wilfred's plumbing pit with such dribble.
As it is said in your country, LET HER ROCK!
Begone! Cursed underlings of Valhalla!
Shed tears no more, fuss-bucket Nazz girl. Rolf will unearth the Ed Boys like the parasite that infects Wilfred's tuchus! This is Rolf's word! …Dawg!
Wilfred! You interrupt Rolf's study! Do you think this is party time for 1999? NO!
